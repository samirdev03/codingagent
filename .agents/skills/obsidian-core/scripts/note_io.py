"""note_io.py - byte-exact read/write for scripts that rewrite vault notes in place.

Scripts that only READ a note may decode forgivingly (errors="replace"); a lossy
copy that dies in memory hurts nobody. A script that reads, edits, and WRITES BACK
must never do that: every undecodable byte would be saved to disk as a permanent
U+FFFD, and the text-mode round-trip would silently rewrite CRLF line endings.

Rule enforced here: strict UTF-8 in, byte-exact UTF-8 out, and a file we cannot
decode losslessly is never rewritten at all.

Writes are atomic. A note is rewritten by writing a sibling temp file and renaming
it over the target, so an interrupted write (Ctrl-C, a crash, a disk that fills
mid-write) can never leave a real note truncated or half-written. The original
survives untouched until one final same-filesystem rename swaps the new bytes in.

Atomic is not the same as safe from a concurrent writer (#217). Every caller here
reads a note, transforms the text, and writes it back, and the gap between the
read and the write is where a second writer's change is lost - silently, because
both writes succeed. A multi-adapter vault runs in exactly that shape: a Hermes
cron agent and a live session against one vault, plus LiveSync landing a third
device's edits as a local file change. `write_exact_if_unchanged` closes that by
checking, immediately before the rename, that the note still holds the bytes the
caller read. It refuses rather than overwrites. See NoteChangedError.

    sync client participates in no lock this process could hold.
