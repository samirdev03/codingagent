"""Find other vault tooling that registers a SessionStart hook (#300).

Claude Code merges hook entries instead of replacing them: "Hook entries merge
across settings levels", "All matching hooks run in parallel", and "A plugin's or
skill's copy of the same handler stays separate"
(https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks). SessionStart adds every hook's stdout to
context. So a user running a second Obsidian plugin gets two operating manuals in
one session, each describing a different folder map and frontmatter schema for the
same vault, with nothing saying which one governs a write.

This module finds the other hook. It does not touch it. The caller states
precedence; nobody's settings are edited, disabled or unregistered.

Two places register a SessionStart command hook:

1. Settings files - `~/.claude/settings.json`, and a project's `.claude/settings.json`
   and `.claude/settings.local.json`. Entries live under `hooks.SessionStart[].hooks[]`.
2. Plugins - each installed plugin's own `hooks/hooks.json`, in the same shape.
   `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` maps a plugin name to its `installPath`.

Every read is defensive. This runs inside the SessionStart hook, where an exception
costs the session its skill root and its vault manual, so a malformed settings file
or a plugin directory that moved yields no detections rather than a traceback.
