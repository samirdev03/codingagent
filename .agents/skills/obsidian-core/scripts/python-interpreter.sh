# Sourced by scripts that shell out to Python, and copied inline into the two
# hooks (hooks/load_vault_context.sh, hooks/validate-ai-first.sh) because those

# tests/test_python_interpreter.py fails when a copy drifts.

# Usage:
#   . "<repo>/scripts/python-interpreter.sh"
#   PYTHON=$(osb_python) || { echo "no python" >&2; exit 1; }
#   $PYTHON script.py          # unquoted: the value may be several words

# Echo a Python that actually runs, or nothing with a non-zero status.
# `command -v python3` is not enough, and on Windows it is actively wrong: the
# python.org installers - the default way to get Python there - ship python.exe
# and py.exe and never python3.exe, so `python3` resolves to the Microsoft Store
# App Execution Alias. That stub exists, prints nothing and exits non-zero, so an
# existence test passes and the caller silently does nothing (#269). Every
# candidate is therefore executed, not looked up. Uses bash 3.2 features only.
