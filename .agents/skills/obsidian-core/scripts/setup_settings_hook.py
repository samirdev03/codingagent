"""Register the SessionStart context hook in ~/.claude/settings.json (idempotent).

install.sh calls this for the skill / manual install so slash commands get the skill
root published into context, exactly as the plugin install does on its own. Without it,
a skill-installed command has no way to locate its bundled scripts.

Safe to re-run: it adds the hook only when an equivalent one is absent, refreshes the
path if the skill moved, and never touches unrelated settings. If settings.json is not
valid JSON it prints a manual instruction and exits 0 rather than clobbering the file.

# The .sh wrapper, not the .py. `python3` is the Microsoft Store App Execution

# the hook injected nothing and said nothing (#269). The wrapper resolves an
