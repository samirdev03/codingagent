# Shared home resolution for the bash half of the toolkit. `source` this file,
# then call osb_platform_home: it sets OSB_WIN (1 on a Windows shell: Git Bash,
# MSYS2, Cygwin; 0 elsewhere) and OSB_HOME.
#
# Home for config and Claude Code state. On Windows shells that is USERPROFILE,
# which is what Python's Path.home() and Claude Code resolve ~ to there; HOME can
# point at another drive (a corporate roaming home) and would split the config
# between the bash and Python halves (#242). Elsewhere HOME is the home.
#
# Sourced by install.sh, update.sh, scripts/setup.sh, scripts/run-command.sh and
# integrations/telegram-journal/setup.sh. Two files carry an inline copy of the
# case block on purpose, because they must stay standalone: hooks/validate-ai-first.sh
# (copied into other harnesses' hook systems by hand) and scripts/quick-install.sh
# (curl | bash, before any checkout exists). tests/test_platform_home.py fails
# when one of the three copies drifts. Uses bash 3.2 features only (macOS ships 3.2).

# an install writes the vault path here with bash and every command reads it back
# with Python, so a disagreement is a config that exists and is never found -

# that both halves resolve the same file, and fails when a new inline copy of
# this line appears.
