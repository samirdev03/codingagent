"""One place that answers "where is the toolkit's config, and what does it say".

Every half of this toolkit needs the same two answers: which file holds the
config, and what a key in it is set to. Before this module the answer was
copied into four Python files and two bash ones, each a slightly different
spelling of the same six lines, and the copies drifted: `scripts/eval/
behavior_eval.py` stopped honouring OBSIDIAN_ENV_FILE at all, so pointing it at
a second config silently kept reading the first.

Copies also go missing, which is the more expensive failure. A caller that
reads only `os.environ` finds nothing when the install wrote the config to the
file and never exported it, and then does nothing and says nothing. That is
#124, #160, #269 and #285: four releases, one bug, four places to fix it.

There is now one place. `tests/test_osb_env.py` fails when a fifth spelling
appears.

Deliberately stdlib-only. The SessionStart hook imports this and must keep
running on a machine with no third-party packages installed, so nothing here
may reach for `dotenv`. Callers that want a full dotenv load still do it; they
just ask this module where the file is.

Precedence, everywhere: a real environment variable wins over the file. The
file is what an install writes; the environment is what an operator overrides
with for one run.
