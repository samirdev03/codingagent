bootstrap_vault.py - Obsidian Second Brain Bootstrapper

Creates a complete, production-ready Obsidian vault from scratch.
Generates folder structure, templates, Home dashboard, kanban boards,
and a _CLAUDE.md so Claude can operate the vault from day one.

AI-first rule: every template emitted by this script must produce
notes that pass `hooks/validate-ai-first.sh`. That means the template
frontmatter must include `date:`, `type:`, `tags:`, and `ai-first: true`,
and the body must include a `## For future agent` preamble. See
`references/ai-first-rules.md` for the full spec. When adding a new
template here, follow the existing shape.

Usage:
    python bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name"
    python bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --preset researcher
    python bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "You" --mode assistant --subject "Boss Name"
    python bootstrap_vault.py --path ~/my-vault --name "Your Name" --style wiki

Options:
    --path        Path where the vault should be created (required)
    --name        Your full name (required)
    --preset      Vault preset: default | executive | builder | creator | researcher
                  (default: "default" - Life OS layout)
    --mode        Operating mode: personal | assistant (default: personal)
    --subject     Subject name (required when --mode=assistant)
    --jobs        Comma-separated list of jobs/companies (default: "Work")
                  Only used by the "default" preset.
    --no-sidebiz  Omit the side business module (default preset only)
    --style       Folder layout: obsidian | wiki (default: obsidian)
                  obsidian - Daily/, People/, Projects/ and the preset's topic folders
                  wiki     - wiki/daily/, wiki/entities/, wiki/projects/, boards/, templates/
                             A preset folder the wiki layout does not rename keeps
                             its own name under wiki/ (Sources/ -> wiki/sources/),
                             so every preset builds the same vault in either layout.

## Auto-Save Rules

Claude should auto-save the following **without asking**:
- Decisions made in conversation → relevant project note + daily note
- New people mentioned → {people}/ (create stub if needed)
- Tasks assigned or committed to → kanban board + {tasks}/ note
- Dev work done → {dev_logs}/ + project note + daily note
{mentions_rule}- Completed tasks → move on kanban to ✅ Done

Claude should **ask before saving**:
{finances_rule}- Anything involving deleting or archiving an existing note

---

## Naming Conventions

- Daily notes: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Dev logs: `YYYY-MM-DD - Description.md`
- People: Full name (e.g. `Jane Smith.md`)
- Archive prefix: `_archived_`

---

## Kanban Convention

Priority: 🔴 critical · 🟡 important · 🟢 low

Active item:
```
- [ ] 🔴 **Title** · @{{YYYY-MM-DD}}
\tDescription. [[Related Project]] [[Person]]
```

Done item:
```
- [x] ~~🔴 **Title**~~ ✅ Date
```

---

## Propagation Rules

| Event | Also update |
|---|---|
| New project | Board (Backlog) + today's daily note |
| Task done | Board (Done) + project note + daily note |
| Dev session | {dev_logs}/ + project note + daily note |

This vault is operated on behalf of someone else. Key differences from personal mode:

- **Voice**: write in {subject}'s voice and perspective, not the operator's
- **Capture logic**: save what matters to {subject}, not what matters to the operator
- **Synthesis focus**: surface patterns relevant to {subject}'s goals and decisions
- **Privacy**: the operator may not have full context - ask before saving sensitive topics
- **Decision records**: always note WHO made the decision (subject or operator)

---

## Subject Profile

- **Role:** [fill in]
- **Company:** [fill in]
- **Communication style:** [fill in]
- **Priorities:** [fill in]
- **Key people:** [fill in]

---

## Operator Rules

- Save everything from conversations the operator has ABOUT the subject
- Flag when the operator's interpretation might differ from the subject's intent
- Keep a clear audit trail - the subject should be able to review what was saved and why
- Never mix the operator's personal notes into this vault
